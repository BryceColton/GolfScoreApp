# GolfScoreApp
This is my golf score app. You can select which golf course you want. After that you select the tee box that you will be playing that game and then how many players there are. You will then enter the names of the players and press enter after entering each one. There is an icon to look at the score card it looks like a spreadsheet you can click on that to look at the scorecard. In the scorecard it will have the yardage, par and handicap of each hole and then total for the coure and the IN and OUT as well. You can click on any cell that on the row of the players name to input the score of the corresponding hole. The totals will automatically update after you press enter on the input. If you want to go back to player card you can click spreadsheet again and it will take you back.
